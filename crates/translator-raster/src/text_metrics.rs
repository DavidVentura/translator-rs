//! Per-line text metrics measured from the ink model's per-line matte.
//!
//! The detection box gives a coarse oriented rect; its height mixes ascenders,
//! descenders and caps, so it varies with *which glyphs* a line happens to
//! contain, its angle (fitted on the raw contour) skews when a tall letter drags
//! the principal axis, and its width clips ~half a glyph off each end. The ink
//! model already runs per line (it also drives colour matting, for free), and its
//! matte sees only ink — so it's the right place to recover the line's true
//! typography:
//!
//! - **x-height** — the dense, column-coherent central band, stable across glyph
//!   content because it ignores the sparse ascender/descender rows.
//! - **centreline & width** — the ink's actual centre and full horizontal extent,
//!   not the (off-centre, clipped) detection box.
//! - **baseline tilt** — the residual lean the rough oriented-box angle missed,
//!   measured from the band's per-column centroid, immune to the ascender drag
//!   that fools contour PCA.
//!
//! These feed paragraph grouping (a glyph-stable size/position beats the wobbly
//! detection box). The same matte can later yield more metrics — stroke width for
//! bold detection, slant for italics — so this is the line's text-metric layer,
//! not a matting detail.
//!
//! Everything here is computed in the matte's rectified strip space (the ink
//! model's per-line output: `mw` columns spanning the box width along the reading
//! axis, `mh` rows — 48 — spanning the box height across it). A stray background
//! blob the model occasionally grabs, or bleed from a neighbouring line through
//! the box's vertical padding, shows up as a band *off* the strip centre; the
//! central-band pick drops it without per-pixel classification.
