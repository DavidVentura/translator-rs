"""Corpus registers: what KIND of text a corpus is, and how much of it to keep.

WHY THIS EXISTS
Concatenating every corpus and sampling uniformly biases hard toward the biggest
source. For en-tl, NLLB alone is 63.5M lines against translatewiki's 23k — a
2,700:1 ratio — so a 10M uniform draw takes ~4k UI lines and the short-input
register effectively does not survive. Measured on the 2026-07-21 en->tl student:
`Right`, `Pull` and `Free` occur ZERO times in the 10M it trained on, and it
emits `Emergency Exit`, `Detour` and `Cash Only` untranslated. The short band it
DID get was ~1.1M XLEnt entity pairs, so what the model learned from short input
was "this is a proper noun, pass it through".

Ratios do not fix this; absolute per-register targets do. `min(cap, available)`
means a pair with 3k UI lines contributes all 3k rather than being diluted to
nothing, which is the common case for the low-resource pairs we care about
(en-sw has 10k UI lines against 872k entity pairs).

WHY ENTITY IS CAPPED RATHER THAN DROPPED
XLEnt/WikiTitles were ADDED deliberately: without any 1-2 word pairs the student
free-runs on short input ("hallo" -> "Hello in the hello"). That fix worked and
the degeneracy checks confirm it. It was simply never bounded, so it took the
whole short band. The cap keeps the anti-degeneracy signal and leaves room for
the rest.

# still useful with these removed ("Delete %d files" -> "Delete files"); it is
# noise with them kept, because the teacher translates them inconsistently and
# the student learns to emit stray format specifiers.
#
# The printf branch carries flags/width/precision/length: a naive `%[sdifgu]`
# misses `%.1f` and `%02d`, which is how "%.1f EB" survived into pool.ui on the
# first smoke run.
# ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING. Alternation is first-match-wins at each position, so
# every %-delimited form must precede the bare printf branch. With printf first,
# `%language%` matched `%la` (l = length modifier, a = conversion) and left
# "nguage%"; `%nation%` became "ation%", `%colony%` became "olony%". That
# silently corrupted 312 UI lines into gibberish ("the ation ve declared war on
