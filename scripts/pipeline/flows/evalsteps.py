"""Eval steps shared by every pair flow. Import these; do not hand-roll per pair.

THE CHECK SET IS A REQUIREMENT, LIKE A TEACHER OR A GPU.
A pair with no check set does not train. The flow refuses, and that refusal is
the feature — the en-tl and sw-en rounds were run end to end on OPUS-MT and
NLLB teachers and produced models that are unusable on real input, which nothing
in the pipeline was positioned to notice. There is deliberately no derived or
default check set to fall back to: an auto-derived one would be drawn from the
teachers' own training corpora, would score well, and would hide exactly the
failure it exists to catch.

WHAT THE tl ROUND SHOWED (2026-07-20)
- FLORES called en->tl a four-way tie inside 3.3 chrF, with the shipped OPUS-MT
  teacher nominally winning. On short/sign/informal input the same four models
  spread over 11.68 chrF and the ranking inverted.
- The teacher gate lived in ad-hoc scripts OUTSIDE pipe, so its numbers were
  chrF-only and undated, and drifted up to 2 points when re-measured.
- The graph (see uigen_v3) ended at `decode` with no eval step at all.

NOTHING HERE FAILS A BUILD ON QUALITY
Missing inputs refuse; bad scores do not. A teacher gate is a choice — you
cannot fix NLLB, only pick differently. And the mechanical checks must never
gate: on tl they scored OPUS-MT 100% clean in the direction where it renders
*Banyo* as "Reflection", ranking it above every better model. They are a defect
list, not a score. Judgment happens by reading `review.txt`, offline, by a human
or an agent.

CHECK SET CONTENT
- en->X: `probes/adversarial.en`, hand-authored, shared by every pair, forever.
- X->en: authored per pair. This is the part that costs someone real work, and
  it is the price of training the pair.

REQUIRED ORDER IN A PAIR FLOW
    teacher_eval  ->  (prep / kd / filter / vocab / train / finetune)  ->  student_eval
Gate the teacher BEFORE renting anything for KD: a student cannot exceed its
teacher, so a teacher that fails here has already decided the outcome, and every
GPU-hour after that point is spent distilling a known-bad model.
