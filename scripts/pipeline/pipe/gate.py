"""The corpus gate: the typed `Raw -> Filtered` stage no round may skip.

Round 1 of uig trained on a corpus that was ~15-20% Arabic-script (töte) Kazakh
because lid.176 only knows Cyrillic Kazakh; a corpus defect is silent by
construction — training succeeds, only the scores are bad. The type system closes
that: decode accepts `Filtered`, never `Raw`, and this module is the only way to
mint a `Filtered`.

Every filter rule is a hypothesis until measured against gold + known_good, and
known_good (the corpus that trained the last student that worked) is the
load-bearing reference: gold is 1012 lines, and a rule costing 0.55% of real text
scored 0/1012 on it. All four hand-asserted rules from 2026-07-17 were wrong or
incomplete on first write; every mined rule was right. The gate is what makes a
plausible rule a measured one, so it is concrete and unskippable, and it refuses
when known_good is absent rather than warning.

Gold is READ by the gate to measure keep-rate; it is never rewritten by it — the
`EvalSet` wrapper never becomes a `Filtered`, so a filtered benchmark cannot leak
into use.
