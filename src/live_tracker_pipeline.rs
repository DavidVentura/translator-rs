//! End-to-end orchestration for the live-camera planar OCR path.
//!
//! Owns the planar tracker engine, the smoothed homography, the
//! resident overlay store, the matted-strip cache, and an internal
//! worker thread that runs the heavy acquire / refresh pipelines off
//! the per-frame critical path. Public surface is intentionally tiny:
//!
//!   * [`LiveTrackerPipeline::process_frame`] — synchronous per-frame
//!     entry. Runs the tracker step, composites directly into a
//!     caller-supplied RGBA slice, and (if needed) materializes the
//!     frame bytes + dispatches an async acquire/refresh job.
//!   * [`LiveTrackerPipeline::set_languages`] — update the language
//!     config used by future async jobs.
//!   * [`LiveTrackerPipeline::set_target_mode`] — toggle between
//!     `Active` (normal operation) and `Suppressed` (e.g. during AF
//!     scans — every frame resets engine state and bumps generation).
//!   * [`LiveTrackerPipeline::reset`] — bump generation, clear engine
//!     + smoothed H + session state. Any in-flight worker job will
//!     observe the new generation and bail.
//!   * [`LiveTrackerPipeline::last_acquire_telemetry`] — pull the most
//!     recent async-job outcome for debug telemetry.
//!
//! Per-frame fast path returns a small `ProcessFrameResult`; the bulk
//! of acquire telemetry lives in `last_acquire_telemetry` because most
//! frames don't trigger an acquire and the per-frame caller doesn't
//! need to allocate / marshal a big struct.
