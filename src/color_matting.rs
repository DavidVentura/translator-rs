//! Per-detection color matting: take the ink model's per-box matte for
//! each recognised text region and produce an inpainted rectified strip
//! suitable for use as a live-overlay background. Replaces the hardcoded
//! dark "pill" with a real per-pixel reconstruction of the camera
//! background under the source text.
//!
//! ## Why a rectified strip
//!
//! The strip is built in **rectified coordinates**, axis-aligned to the
//! detection's oriented box. That is the frame the GPU compositor warps
//! back per-frame, and it matches the frame the ink model's matte was
//! rendered in, so the matte registers onto the strip without a separate
//! reprojection.
//!
//! At acquire time, the `MattedStrip` produced here feeds the GPU overlay
//! compositor as a textured quad (its coverage alpha lets the camera show
//! through between strokes), and the GPU warps the baked overlay per-frame by
//! the planar-tracker homography (canonical → viewport coords).
//!
//! ## Pipeline per detection
//!
//! 1. Take the ink model's soft 0..255 matte for the box (from
//!    `PpocrEngine::ink_masks`, rendered in the box's oriented-box frame).
//! 2. Project every box's matte into one image-space *union* ink mask:
//!    walk the box's source-space bounding box, map each pixel back to
//!    the matte via the oriented frame, and set the union where the alpha
//!    clears `INK_ALPHA_CUT`. The union lets a tall strip erase the
//!    neighbouring lines that fall inside its padding.
//! 3. Derive the box's foreground colour as the median of its ink pixels —
//!    the model says *what* is ink, the pixels say what colour it is — for
//!    the translated text.
//! 4. Dewarp the camera + union ink mask into a rectified strip aligned
//!    to the oriented box, growing the fill mask by a height-proportional
//!    radius so the original ink's anti-aliased rim is erased too.
//! 5. Replace the masked pixels with a block-median background field
//!    (`background_field`): smooth, gradient-following, and robust in
//!    dense text where a directional inpaint can't find clean samples.
//!    The strip's alpha records that coverage so consumers paint only the
//!    erased pixels.
//!
//! Output: rectified RGBA strip + the oriented-box parameters
//! needed to re-warp it back to canonical-frame coords.

/// Cells with too few background pixels (fully inside thick ink) are
