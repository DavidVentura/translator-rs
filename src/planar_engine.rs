//! Lifecycle state machine + anchor LRU cache for the planar tracker.
//!
//! `planar_tracker` does pure per-frame detection / matching / fitting.
//! This module owns:
//!   - the Acquiring → Locked → Lost state machine (Phase E)
//!   - what counts as "scene change" / "refresh needed" (E + F)
//!   - the LRU cache of recently-seen anchors with their translated
//!     overlay sets, so flipping back to a known scene is instant (G)
//!
//! See `FUTURE_PLANAR_TRACKER.md` for the design rationale.
