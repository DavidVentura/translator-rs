//! Cross-platform live-translate session state.
//!
//! Holds the orchestration state that's shared between the Android
//! `LivePlanarTracker` (uniffi-exposed) and the `surface_sim`
//! desktop binary. The goal is **one source of truth** for the
//! pipeline: tracking → detection → surface-map update → recognition
//! → translation → overlay update. Without this, every new feature
//! (re-OCR triggers, pixel stripes, etc.) has to be implemented
//! twice and the two implementations drift.
//!
//! This module starts small: it owns the persistent `SurfaceMap`
//! and is grown in subsequent phases to encompass the engine,
//! overlay store, matting cache, and the orchestration methods
//! themselves. See FUTURE_SURFACE_MAP.md for the bigger plan.

    ///   narrow new bbox inside a wide old bbox has low IoU).
    /// - Displace by IoU > 0.5 OR containment > 0.7: catches the
