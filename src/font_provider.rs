//! Font lookup interface for PDF and image output.
//!
//! The translator crate is platform-agnostic: it does not know about
//! `/system/fonts`, `fonts.xml`, `AFontMatcher`, fontconfig, CoreText, etc.
//! Consumer applications (Android, native Linux, …) own that knowledge and
//! expose it through this trait.
//!
//! Both the PDF writer and the image renderer ask for a font when they have
//! decided what to render and what style is needed. The provider returns a
//! preference-ordered chain of TrueType / OpenType files that should cover
//! the requested script + style; the writer picks the first one whose cmap
//! covers the codepoint(s) at hand.
